					<h3>Why am I studying Computer Science</h3>
					<p>
						5 weeks ago, I started a new chapter of my life. I began studying
						Computer Science and IT at NUIG. My journey to this major section of
						my life began in childhood. Let me fill you in.
					</p>
					<p>
						I remember being harassed in secondary school by my career guidance
						teacher, constantly demanding I tell her what I wanted to do after
						the Leaving Cert. I had no idea; all I knew was that I wanted to go
						to university (there was no way I was going to miss out on the
						student life!).
					</p>
					<p>
						I tried picking a course based on my interests—I had so many, such
						as swimming, video editing, woodworking, chess... I could continue
						listing them all day.
					</p>
					<p>But then it hit me.</p>
					<p>
						While training in the pool, I would often let my mind wander while
						my body moved on autopilot. I made mental lists of what I wanted to
						achieve in life. I wanted a good job that I enjoyed, but I also
						wanted to know what I truly loved doing.
					</p>
					<p>
						I remember the day my mom came home from work carrying a black box.
						She set it on the couch, and my curiosity got the better of me. I
						dropped my Lego pieces and moved over. I recognized the power
						button—it was the same as the one on our TV remote—so I pressed it.
						The screen lit up, just like my eyes in amazement.
					</p>
					<p>A tiny TV?</p>
					<p>No.</p>
					<p>
						I later learned that it could do so much more than just display
						videos—in the coming years it would allow for button clicks, app
						launches, and a venture into the 8th Wonder of the World: the World
						Wide Web.
					</p>
					<p>
						My parents noticed my interest in computers and suggested I try
						CoderDoJo. It started with Scratch—a cat floating across the
						screen—but quickly became a Snake game, Donkey Kong, and even Space
						Invaders. I even attended Whizzkidz one summer and learned the
						basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
					</p>
					<p>But one day, it all just stopped.</p>
					<p>
						Despite that, I never lost my fascination with technology. Between
						watching Linus Tech Tips and investing time into researching
						computers before building my own PC, I always made time for tech,
						cherishing every minute. That is why I chose to study Computer
						Science.
					</p>
					<p>
						I was, however, worried about getting lost during lectures after
						forgetting so much from Python and JavaScript. With the Leaving Cert
						around the corner and high points required for acceptance, I had
						doubts about my decision.
					</p>
					<p>
						I wondered if I had chosen this path just to avoid saying "I dunno"
						when asked about university options. Yet, the promise of a
						fulfilling job propelled me forward.
					</p>
					<p>And it paid off.</p>
					<p>I got the course!</p>
					<p>
						This was the most important decision of my life and, so far, the
						best one. I've met passionate people with similar interests and am
						enjoying my studies more than I ever expected.
					</p>
